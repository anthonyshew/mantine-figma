# The (unofficial) Mantine Figma library

Developers love Mantine. Let's make sure designers do, too.

## Goals

Our goal is to create a 1:1 mapping of Mantine in Figma as much as we can.

We want to improve iteration speed by creating a great designer-to-developer handoff experience.
We do this by using Mantine's props as options for the Figma component, allowing developers and designers to speak the same language while they work.
